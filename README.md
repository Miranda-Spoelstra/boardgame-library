# Boardgame Library

Why? Because I needed a project to experiment with React and I like boardgames.

This project is made with React, Redux, Typescipt and Vite. Styling is implemented with Tailwind CSS.
It is a learning project, so most of the time a work in progress.

## Run the project

To run the project, use 2 commands in different terminals.  

- Run the application: `npm run dev`
- Run the local db: `npm run start:server`
